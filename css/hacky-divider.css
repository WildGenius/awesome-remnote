/**THIS IS A HACK. USE ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
 * Replace a highlight color (here purple) with a divider.
 * 
 * There is still an empty, semantically invalid rem but once dividers
 * are released these things could be replaced semi-automatically using the 
 * â®‰ Highlight Power-Up rem.
 * 
 * To look nicely you have to leave it empty or you disable the bullet point with /none
 * and set color to transparent (commented below).
